This directory contains cstool of Capstone Engine.

Cstool is a command-line tool to disassemble assembly hex-string.
For example, to decode a hexcode string for Intel 32bit, run:

	$ cstool x32 "90 91"

	0	90	nop
	1	91	xchg	eax, ecx

Cstool disassembles the input and prints out the assembly instructions.
On each line, the first column is the instruction offset, the second
column is opcodes, and the rest is the instruction itself.

Cstool is flexible enough to accept all kind of hexcode format. The following
inputs have the same output with the example above.

	$ cstool x32 "0x90 0x91"
	$ cstool x32 "\x90\x91"
	$ cstool x32 "90,91"
	$ cstool x32 "90;91"
	$ cstool x32 "90+91"
	$ cstool x32 "90:91"

To see all the supported options, run ./cstool
